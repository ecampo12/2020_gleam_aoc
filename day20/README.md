Day 20 is doable in gleam, but it's a grid problem, and I don't want to do it in gleam.
The problem invloves flipping and rotating multiple grids to make the edges of the girds match up.
The way I've been solving grids involves using dicts to store the grid elements, which makes it difficult to print the grid out to debug.

I aleady have a solution in python, and I alrady have the stars for the problem.
I might come back to this in gleam, but for now, I'm going to leave it as is.
